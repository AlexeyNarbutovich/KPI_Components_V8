# KPI_Components_V8
Practical work #1
### Variant 8: 1/(1+x)
* Create a branch named Main holding implementation of the equation having the number of Taylor series members hardcoded to 4. Application version has to be set to 1.0.0.
 
* Fork new branch from main creating an application version 1.0.1
In this branch change the implementation making the number of Taylor series members to be definable through API.
 
* Fork branch 1.0.1 making version 1.0.2
In this branch implement unit test for your function.
 
* Switch to branch Main:
rename the function returning Taylor series adding letter A to its name
 
* Integrate branch 1.0.2 to Main solving a conflict in favor of the new name.
 
* Set version of the application in Main branch to 1.1.0
 
* Demo how you launch the Unit test
